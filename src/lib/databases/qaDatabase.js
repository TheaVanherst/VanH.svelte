        question: "Do you do commissions?",
        answer: "I do! Commissions are first open to members, if members don't fill all available slots, slots will then be open to supporters, and eventually go to twitter. There's very low chances for commissions to open publicly, so to grab a slot, make sure to support me via. a donation."

        question: "What got you interested into Macro / Hyper?",
        answer: "I'm emotionally devoid from a lot of sexual content, and I find the idea and concepts of things attractive as a result; things like hyper are an abstract to which is not possible, so the fascination of it is something that is endless simply because it cannot exist otherwise. "

        question: "Whom inspires you the most as an artist?",
        answer: "I don't really have typical inspirations like artists and the longer I am an artist the less likely I am to cling onto anyone specifically. Dispite that; Cherax Destructor is probably one of the only idols I've ever had, I adore her music and aspire to have vibes like her."

        question: "Can I draw one of your characters?",
        answer: "Of course! As long as you credit me for the design of the character, and try your best to treat my characters with respect, you're more than fine to do so. Though, I please forward your creations to me of course, I would love to see the final product."
